# ProductivityRot

This is a producitivty app to track how many Sigma, Skibidi and Ohio points you get!

(This is a satirical project created for the [brainrot jia.seed hackathon](https://brainrot-jia-seed-hackathon.devpost.com/))

## Points Structure
For completing computer scientist activities you can earn three types of points:
- Sigma points: the best (3x multiplier)
- Skibidi points: positive actions (1x multiplier)
- Ohio points: bad bad bad! (-1x multiplier)

All of which come together to generate an Aura point score.

This app compares entered values by the user and looks them up within a Google Sheets 'database'.

## 💡 Inspiration
We're all slaying compsci uni students 🎓 that just want to get flex our productivity levels 📈. No cap 🧢, we wanted to come up with something that is the GOAT 🐐 of productivity, because they say you doin too much. 😰

Two of us low-key stan the 'skibidi rizz bomb' 🥃💥 at [a local pub](http://weststreetlive.co.uk/). They're bussin, and bruh: they're cheap. High key finna get some after submitting.

## 👷‍♂️ What it does
**ProductivityRot** is the skibidi rizz bomb of productivity management apps. Broski, you 🫵🫵🫵 can measure your work in Ohio, Skibidi and Sigma points. You gotta hawk _tuah_ and spit on dem points.

Chat, who can get the most aura 🌪️ points? Or even some 💖💖rizz💖💖 points? Top scorer gets a grimace shake, (maybe some cap 🧢)

For realz, this app identifies your compsci keywords (think shower, internship, energy drink) and assigns ohio (😭👎📉), sigma (🏆😁🎉) or skibidi (🙂👍👌) points from our Google Sheets database. These points are multiplied with super secret maths (❌➖1️⃣, ❎3️⃣, ❎1️⃣) to produce the ultimate Aura points score.

### What the sigma? I earned 💗💗Rizz💗💗 points and got nothing 😭
That's right. Being _the_ rizzler gives nothing in productivity 🚫🚫. You're just a sus compsci 🤨. Bruh, do you want negative aura 💨?

### This project ate!

## ⚒️ How we built it
Bruh, can't you see 👀? We yeeted three tech components 💻🕹️ together to make low key 🤫 one of the most lit 🔥 projects ever

### 💿 Google Sheets ❌🗒️
Our 'database' (no cap! 🧢). Storing the cold hard facts 🥶 from skibidi compsci statements (like compile ⌨️) to ohio statements (like shower 🚿) and even to sigma statements (like internship 🧑‍💻), this stores all the data you could need.

Google Sheets are giving future 🔮. They know all and they got da drip 💧... especially our database.

### ⚡️ React Front-end ⏰
Did you see that? Our front-end reacts faster than you can say _SKIBIDI RIZZ BOMB_!! Sheesh, that's a cool front end 🤩 - said you when you see it. We used React for our frontend with Bootstrap for layout 🥾. It's mad lit 🔥

Do you get the vibes from the subway surfer 🚇🏄 and minecraft parkour ⛏️🧵 video snippets? They're there so you stay focussed, nerd 🤓‼️ They're just simple GIFs, pretty bussin', eh?

This component 🔋 turns skibidi sigmas into aura points! Using point mulitpliers 📈🎱, your tasks turn into mad lit points! Too much yapping 🗣️? Get those taks completed, fam!

### 😭💀👉👈👁👄👁 skibidi, rizz & sigma 🏆
Our three key themes 🚽❤️🤴. Our `chad alpha` if you will. Not to glaze 🥫 but they're the butter to our bread. Sheesh, they're the OGs to skibidi rizz meow hacks! 🙀

## 😫 Challenges we ran into
_Hits different_! 📅 We're all busy... I'm going delulu 🤪😵‍💫 writing this at 3am before a 4.30am deadline 😴⏰

Our biggest challenge 😰 was finding the time ⌚️ in our busy schedules to work on this project. Too much brain rot 🧠😶‍🌫️ watching!!

It's sus, but we finished with aura 🐠 and a cumulative 10 BLAHAJs 🦈, providing the ultimate sigma points to the team 🧑‍🧑‍🧒

## 🎖️ Accomplishments that we're proud of
MY GYATT, WE DID IT 🔥✅🍾

Bruh, that was hard 😓. We processed data 📊 from our everyday tasks and turned it into the skibidiest rizz points 👆 for aura. No cap 🧢, we tried our best here! Zang, we ate this 🍽️ and left noooo crumbs 🍞

The processing of data from a random stream using rizz intelligence™️ into aura points is our proudest achievement 💣 We did not take the L this weekend, and instead managed to finish!

## 📚 What we learned
### Gen Alpha ⍶ skibidi rizz terms.
We learned that our opps (like don pollo 🐣) can be friendly 👯 and not a scary cannibal 💀!

This hackathon hit different 😎 props to jia.seed for the skibidi theme! Ngl ⛔️ we entered this having no plans, other than our two idols: skibidi rizz bombs and chill guy <3. So we gave chill guy some drippppp

## 🔮 What's next for Skibidi Rizz Meow Bombs
Multiplayer! 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒 We know skibidies want to rizz their family 🤔 so why not allow competitions between aura leaderboards 🎛️ across houses, countries or even the world 🌍! Spill the tea 🫖 and share your sigma points with others 🏆. 

Saved data would be a great feature to add to _Skibidi Rizz Meow Bombs_ 🚽😻💣 so that you can reload the app and get your state back! 📈📉
