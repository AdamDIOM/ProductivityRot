# ProductivityRot

This is a producitivty app to track how many Sigma, Skibidi and Ohio points you get!

-# This is a satirical project created for the [brainrot jia.seed hackathon](https://brainrot-jia-seed-hackathon.devpost.com/)

## Points Structure
For completing computer scientist activities you can earn three types of points:
- Sigma points: the best (3x multiplier)
- Skibidi points: positive actions (1x multiplier)
- Ohio points: bad bad bad! (-1x multiplier)

All of which come together to generate an Aura point score.

This app compares entered values by the user and looks them up within a Google Sheets 'database'.
